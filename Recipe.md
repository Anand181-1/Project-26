1. Boil 1 litre milk.
2. Put 1 tbls vinegar or 2 tbls lemon extracts.
3. Stir it till the milk gets curdle.
4. After the milk gets curdle put the curdled milk in a small piece of cloth.
5. Pour some fresh water over it and then squeeze the chhena very nicely so that the extra water would drain out and the chhena would
   be less moisturised.   OR   If you have time you can keep it as it is for 4 hours.
6. Now leave it for some time and till that time we can make the syrup of the dessert.
7. Boil 500ml of milk and add saffron and cardamom with nuts if you want to use.
8. Keep stiring the milk and after sometime add 100g of sugar in it. If you want you can also put food colour in it.
9. After everything mixes up you can leave it and come to make sugar syrup.
10. Add 400g of sugar in 6 big cups of water.
11. Now smash the paneer and make a soft dough.
12. Now make small-small balls of the dough and flat them up between the palms. Make sure that the balls should not have any cracks.
13. Put them into the sugar syrup and boil them till they absorb the syrup nicely.
14. Now after that cool, sqeeze and put them into the milk syrup.
15. You have made the dessert now serve it as you want.
